## Randomized Extended Kaczmarz

### Overview

The current project contains an implementation of the algorithm described in the research paper [1]. The Randomized Extended Kaczmarz algorithm is a randomized algorithm for solving least-squares/linear regression problems. The current project provides implementations of REK in C, C++, Java and Matlab (wriiten in C with mex-files integrations).
